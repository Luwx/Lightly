*Lightly* is a fork of breeze theme style that aims to be visually modern and minimalistic. 

## Development ⚠️

Lightly is a work in progress theme, there is still a lot to change, so expect bugs! Some applications may suddenly crash or flicker.

If you have any feedback or encounter some bugs, feel free to open an issue or a pr.


## Screenshots

With transparent dolphin view off and no sidebar transparency:

With a full glass color scheme (currently full glass color schemes are very buggy and not fully supported):

## Configuration

![config page](https://github.com/Luwx/Lightly/blob/master/config.png)

Lightly configuration page can be found in the KDE system settings under the Application style section. 


Most of these options are inherited from Breeze style, but Lightly has a few exclusive options that are enabled by default, including:

* Transparent Dolphin view (under the **frames** tab). This option disables the background and shadows of Dolphin view widget and draws top and bottom separators when the view has scrollable content.

*  Sidebar opacity (under the **transparency** tab). By default, it's 60. If it's bellow 100, shadows will be drawn automatically. 

The toolbar and menubar will follow the **titlebar** opacity. To configure the titlebar opacity, you will have to change the color scheme file directly in ~/.local/share/color-schemes. Open your desired color scheme and, in the ```[WM]``` section, add a fourth value to ```activeBackground``` and ```inactiveBackground```, like ```activeBackground=0,0,0,127``` where the last value is the alpha, that ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (totally opaque).
